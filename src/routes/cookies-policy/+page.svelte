                our website at <a href="https://www.thrivehub.ai"></a>https://www.thrivehub.ai <strong>("Website")</strong>. It explains what these
                technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our
                use of them.
            </p>

            <p class="content">
                In some cases we may use cookies to collect personal information, or that

            <p class="content">
                Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile
                device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners
                in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to
                provide reporting information.

            </p>

            <p class="content">
                Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Thrive Hub) are called "firstparty cookies." Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are
                called "third-party cookies." Third-party cookies enable third-party features or
                functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g., advertising,
                interactive content, and analytics). The parties that set these third-party
                cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website in
                question and also when it visits certain other websites.

            <p class="content">
                We use first- and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are
                required for technical reasons in order for our Website to operate, and we
                refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies
                also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the
                experience on our Online Properties. Third parties serve cookies through our
                Website for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in
                more detail below.

            <p class="content">
                You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can
                exercise your cookie rights by setting your preferences in the Cookie
                Consent Manager. The Cookie Consent Manager allows you to select which
                categories of cookies you accept or reject. Essential cookies cannot be
                rejected as they are strictly necessary to provide you with services
            </p>

            <p class="content">
                The Cookie Consent Manager can be found in the notification banner and on
                our Website. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our Website
                though your access to some functionality and areas of our Website may be
                restricted. You may also set or amend your web browser controls to accept or
                refuse cookies.

                The specific types of first- and third-party cookies served through our Website

            <p class="content">
                Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website. We
                may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons
                (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs"). These are tiny graphics
                files that contain a unique identifier that enables us to recognize when
                someone has visited our Website or opened an email including them. This
                allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page
                within a website to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to
                understand whether you have come to the website from an online
                advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site
                performance, and to measure the success of email marketing campaigns. In
                many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function
                 properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.
            </p>

            <h1 id="do-you-see-flash-cookies-or-local-shared-objects">Do you use Flash cookies or Local Shared Objects?</h1>
            <p class="content">
                Websites may also use so-called "Flash Cookies" (also known as Local
                Shared Objects or "LSOs") to, among other things, collect and store
                information about your use of our services, fraud prevention, and for other
                site operations.
            </p>

            <p class="content">
                If you do not want Flash Cookies stored on your computer, you can adjust the
                settings of your Flash player to block Flash Cookies storage using the tools
                contained in the <a href="https://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html">Website Storage Settings Panel</a>. You can also control Flash
                Cookies by going to the <a href="https://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager03.html">Global Storage Settings Panel</a> and following the
                instructions (which may include instructions that explain, for example, how to
                delete existing Flash Cookies (referred to "information" on the Macromedia
                site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from being placed on your computer without
                your being asked, and (for Flash Player 8 and later) how to block Flash
                Cookies that are not being delivered by the operator of the page you are on
                at the time).
            </p>

            <p class="content">
                Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of
                Flash Cookies may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash
                applications, including, potentially, Flash applications used in connection with
                our services or online content.
