			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Consent:</strong> We may process your information if you have given us permission

				8. IS YOUR INFORMATION TRANSFERRED INTERNATIONALLY?
			</h2>
			<p>
				<strong>In Short:</strong> We may transfer, store, and process your information in countries
				other than your own.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our servers are located in the United States. If you are accessing our Services from outside
				the United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored by,
				and processed by us in our facilities and in the facilities of the third parties with whom
				we may share your personal information (see <a href="#share-info"
					>"WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?"</a
				> above), in the United States, and other countries.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you are a resident in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), or
				Switzerland, then these countries may not necessarily have data protection laws or other
				similar laws as comprehensive as those in your country. However, we will take all necessary
				measures to protect your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Notice and
				applicable law.
			</p>

			<h3>European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses</h3>
			<p>
				We have implemented measures to protect your personal information, including by using the
				European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal information
				between our group companies and between us and our third-party providers. These clauses
				require all recipients to protect all personal information that they process originating
				from the EEA or UK in accordance with European data protection laws and regulations. Our
				Standard Contractual Clauses can be provided upon request. We have implemented similar
				appropriate safeguards with our third-party service providers and partners, and further

			</p>
			<p>
				We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes
				set out in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by
				law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will
				require us keeping your personal information for longer than twelve (12) months past the
				termination of the user's account.
			</p>
			<p>
				When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we
				will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example,
				because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely
				store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is
				possible.

				<strong>In Short:</strong> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational

			</p>
			<p>
				We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security
				measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However,
				despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission
				over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so
				we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third
				parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or
				modify your information.
			</p>
			<p>
				Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal
				information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the

			<h2 class="headings" id="privacy-rights">12. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
			<p>
				<strong>In Short:</strong> Depending on your state of residence in the US or in some regions,
				such as the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), Switzerland, and Canada, you have
				rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review,
				change, or terminate your account at any time, depending on your country, province, or state
				of residence.
			</p>

			<p>
				In some regions (like the EEA, UK, Switzerland, and Canada), you have certain rights under
				applicable data protection laws. These may include the right:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>To request access and obtain a copy of your personal information</li>
				<li>To request rectification or erasure</li>
				<li>To restrict the processing of your personal information</li>

				<a href="#contact-us">"HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?"</a> below.
			</p>

			<p>
				We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection
				laws.
			</p>

			<p>
				If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your
				personal information, you also have the right to complain to your Member State data
				protection authority or UK data protection authority. If you are located in Switzerland, you
				may contact the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner.
			</p>

			<h3>Withdrawing Your Consent</h3>
			<p>
				If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express
				and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your

				contact details provided in the section
				<a href="#contact-us">"HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?"</a> below or updating your

			<h3>Opting Out of Marketing and Promotional Communications</h3>
			<p>
				You can unsubscribe from our marketing and promotional communications at any time by

				"UNSUBSCRIBE" to the SMS messages that we send, or by contacting us using the details
				provided in the section
				<a href="#contact-us">"HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?"</a> below. You will then be
				removed from the marketing lists. However, we may still communicate with you — for example, to
				send you service-related messages that are necessary for the administration and use of your account,
				to respond to service requests, or for other non-marketing purposes.
			</p>

			<h3>Account Information</h3>
			<p>
				If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or
				terminate your account, you can:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Log in to your account settings and update your user account.</li>
				<li>Contact us using the contact information provided.</li>

				Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and

		<div class="content">
			<h2 class="headings" id="do-not-track">13. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
			<p>
				Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a
				Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference
				not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this
				stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been
				finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other
				mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online.
			</p>
			<p>
				If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will
				inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.
			</p>
			<p>
				California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT signals.
				Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT
				signals, we do not respond to them at this time.

			<h3 class="headings">How to Exercise Your Rights</h3>
			<p>
				To exercise these rights, you can contact us by submitting a data subject access request, by
				emailing us at
				<a href="mailto:ops@thrivehub.ai">ops@thrivehub.ai</a>, or by referring to the contact
				details at the bottom of this document.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can opt out from the selling of your personal information, targeted advertising, or
				profiling by disabling cookies in Cookie Preference Settings.
			</p>
			<p>
				Under certain US state data protection laws, you can designate an authorized agent to make a
				request on your behalf. We may deny a request from an authorized agent that does not submit
				proof that they have been validly authorized to act on your behalf in accordance with
				applicable laws.
			</p>

			<h3 class="headings">Request Verification</h3>
			<p>
				Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the
				same person about whom we have the information in our system. We will only use personal
				information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the
				request. However, if we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained
				by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying
				your identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you submit the request through an authorized agent, we may need to collect additional
				information to verify your identity before processing your request and the agent will need
				to provide a written and signed permission from you to submit such request on your behalf.
			</p>

			<h3 class="headings">Appeals</h3>
			<p>
				Under certain US state data protection laws, if we decline to take action regarding your
				request, you may appeal our decision by emailing us at
				<a href="mailto:ops@thrivehub.ai">ops@thrivehub.ai</a>. We will inform you in writing of any
				action taken or not taken in response to the appeal, including a written explanation of the
				reasons for the decisions. If your appeal is denied, you may submit a complaint to your
				state attorney general.
			</p>
			<h3 class="headings">Financial Incentives</h3>
			<p>
				"Financial incentive" means a program, benefit, or other offering, including payments to
				consumers as compensation, for the disclosure, deletion, sale, or sharing of personal
				information.
			</p>
			<p>
				The law permits financial incentives or a price or service difference if it is reasonably
				related to the value of the consumer’s data. A business must be able to explain how the
				financial incentive or price or service difference is reasonably related to the value of the
				consumer’s data. The explanation must include:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					A good-faith estimate of the value of the consumer’s data that forms the basis for
					offering the financial incentive or price or service difference; and
				</li>
				<li>
					A description of the method the business used to calculate the value of the consumer’s
					data.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				We may decide to offer a "bona fide loyalty program" under Colorado law, or a "financial
				incentive" under California law (e.g., price or service difference) in exchange for the
				retention, sale, or sharing of a consumer’s personal information.
			</p>
			<p>
				If we decide to offer a financial incentive, we will notify you of such financial incentive
				and explain the price difference, as well as material terms of the financial incentive or
				price of service difference, including the categories of personal information that are
				implicated by the financial incentive or price or service difference.
			</p>
			<p>
				Under California law, the value of your personal information to us is related to the value
				of the free or discounted products or services, or other benefits that you obtain or that
				are provided as part of the applicable program, less the expense related to offering those
				products, services, and benefits to program participants.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you choose to participate in the financial incentive you can withdraw from the financial
				incentive at any time by emailing us at
				<a href="mailto:ops@thrivehub.ai">ops@thrivehub.ai</a>, or by referring to the contact
				details at the bottom of this document.
			</p>
			<h3 class="headings">California "Shine The Light" Law</h3>

				California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the "Shine The Light" law, permits our
				users who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of
				charge, information about categories of personal information (if any) we disclosed to third
				parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all third parties with
